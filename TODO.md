# TODO: Fix Frontend-Backend Routing Issue

## Current Status:
✅ Backend is running on port 5001 and successfully serving the built frontend
✅ Frontend build found at: C:\Users\DANTECH\Desktop\سراجا\siraj\backend\frontend\dist

## Steps to Resolve:

1. [✅] Backend server is running on port 5001
2. [ ] Access the application at http://localhost:5001 (not 3000)
3. [ ] Test that the frontend loads correctly
4. [ ] Test that API endpoints work properly
5. [ ] Test that refresh works without returning to backend welcome message

## Important Notes:
- You don't need to run the frontend development server (port 3000)
- The backend is already serving the built frontend
- Access the application at http://localhost:5001

## If you need to rebuild the frontend:
```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build --prefix frontend

# Restart backend
npm run dev --prefix backend
```

## Expected Results:
- Frontend should be accessible at http://localhost:5001
- No more "Welcome to the Siraj API!" message when accessing the root
- Refresh should work correctly showing the frontend
